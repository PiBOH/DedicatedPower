## Installation

1. Install [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) for Minecraft 26.2.
2. Install [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) for Minecraft 26.2.
3. Install Java 25 or newer.
4. Download the latest DedicatedPower release from the [Releases](https://github.com/PiBOH/DedicatedPower/releases) page.
5. Place the DedicatedPower `.jar` file in the server's `mods` folder.
6. Start the dedicated server.

Always make a backup of your server before installing or updating mods.

## Usage

DedicatedPower is loaded automatically when the dedicated server starts. The enhanced server window is created by the mod and can be used to monitor the server and run commands. The console panel streams live server log output with color-coded levels and accepts commands entered through the GUI.

Use the **Server**, **World**, and **Tools** menus to access the available controls. Commands should be entered without the leading slash, for example:

```text
save-all
```

## Building from source

### Requirements

- JDK 25
- Git
- Internet access for Gradle and Minecraft dependencies

### Build commands

Clone the repository and build the mod with the Gradle wrapper:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PiBOH/DedicatedPower.git
cd DedicatedPower
./gradlew build
```

On Windows, use:

```bat
gradlew.bat build
```

The compiled files are generated in `build/libs/`.

## Development status

DedicatedPower is actively being updated for Minecraft 26.2. The project uses the official Minecraft names and the non-remapping Fabric Loom toolchain introduced for newer unobfuscated Minecraft versions.

The project currently focuses on the dedicated server GUI and administration workflow. Some advanced features from earlier versions may be reintroduced or expanded in future updates.
